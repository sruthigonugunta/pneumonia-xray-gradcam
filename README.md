# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays (Streamlit App + Grad-CAM)
This project includes code for training a ResNet50 model to classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal, and a Streamlit app to make predictions on uploaded images with Grad-CAM heatmap visualization.

Built as part of my interest in combining biomedical engineering and machine learning for medical diagnostics.
